# Definition

- An artery dilatation >50% (X1.5) of its original diameter is called aneurysm
- True aneurysm: dilatation of all layers of the blood vessels
- False aneurysm (pseudoaneurysm): dilatation of aventitia which communicated with lumen usually following trauma
- Types of aneurysms are listed
    - Berry aneurysm- bulges from one side of the artery
    - Fusiform aneurysm- bulges from all sides of an artery
    - Giant aneurysm- involve more than one artery. It is over 2.5 cm wide
    - Mycotic aneurysm- caused by infected artery wall

# Aetiology (similar to cardiovascular risk factors)

- Male
- Over 65 years of age
- Atherosclerotic factors: hypertension, smoking, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes
- Family history of AAA: 10% risk if first-degree relative affected
- Congenital - berry aneurysms
- Infective - mycotic aneurysms
- Traumatic - non/penetrative
- Inflammatory - vasculitis
- Connective tissue disorders - certain conditions here can predispose to aneurysm formation therefore should be monitored regularly. Such conditions include Marfan's Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
- Cocaine - can cause aortic, cerebral and peripheral aneurysms

> REMEMBER: 1 in 25 males over 65, without having additional risk factors, will be found to have an AAA. However, 1 in 6 males with accompanying risks factors, will have an AAA. 

# Examination

- Normal abdominal aorta will be pulsatile not expansile
- AAA will be pulsatile and expansile
- Expansile abdominal mass (it expands and contracts)
- Swelling that are just pulsatile
- Shock (in rupture)

Genetic component involved so there is familial cluster. Ask specifically for family Hx of AAA or other aneurysm

# Common sites of AAA

- Aortic (infra-renal accounts for 90% of cases) [[^1]]
- Iliac
- Popliteal (accounts of 80% of all peripheral aneurysm, usually bilateral)
- Femoral (can be felt as lump in the groin)
- Thoracic aneurysms (accounts for 10% of cases)

# Presentation

- **Unruptured AAA**
    - Often none
    - May cause abdominal/back pain
    - Often discovered incidentally in US or CT KUB
- **Ruptured AAA** (rupturing largely dependent on the size and rate of increase of the diameter)
    - Intermittent or continuous abdominal pain (radiates to back, iliac fossae, or grain  Do not confuse with renal colic)
    - Collapse
    - HypovolaemicShock (tachycardia, tachypnoea, sweating, syncope and collapse)

# Differential diagnosis

- Renal colic
- Acute pancreatitis
- Diverticulitis
- Testicular pain
- Erosion of vertebral bodies

> NEVER miss AAA in someone complaining of loin to groin pain.

# Complications of AAA

- Rupture (increases with age for individuals >65yrs)
- Thrombosis/embolism
    - Blood often slow around the edges of aneurysm sac leading to thrombus formation and emboli occluding peripheral arteries è pt can present with limb ischaemia/claudication
- Fistulae
- Pressure on surrounding structure

# Investigations

- Imaging
    - US for monitoring
    - CT for anatomical details, to look for ‘crescent sign’- sign of impending rupture
- Other
    - FBC, clotting factor, renal and liver function, and cross match for surgery

# Risk management and treatment[[NICE]][1]
## Low rupture risk

<figcaption class="figure-caption text-left mt-0">Management of abdominal aortic aneurysm</figcaption>

- asymptomatic, aortic diameter <5.5cm
- 3.5 - 4cm = annual check
- 4 -5cm = 6-monthly check
- treat with abdominal US surveillance and aggressively optimise cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. stop smoking)
##High rupture risk  
- symptomatic, aortic diameter >=5.5cm or rapidly enlarging (>1cm/year)
- treat with
- elective endovascular repair (EVAR) is preferred over open repair
    - In EVAR a stent is placed into the abdominal aorta via the femoral artery to prevent blood from collecting in the aneurysm.
    - Less mortality but higher graft complication e.g. failure of stent-graft to totally exclude blood flow to the aneurysm ‘endoleak’ (lifelong CT follow-up required)
