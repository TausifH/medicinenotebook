# Key facts
- Overlap with HUS and often considered a spectrum with HUS
- Symptoms and signs of TTP usually more severe than HUS
- Unexplained thrombocytopenia + anaemia → prompt investigation
- Diagnosis made clinically

# Pathophysiology
- Genetic or acquired deficiency of a **protease (ADAMTS13)** which normally cleaves multimers of vWF → large vWF forms → causes platelet aggregation and fibrin deposition in small vessels

# Aetiologies
- Idiopathic (40%)
- Autoimmune (SLE)
- Cancer
- Pregnancy (rule out HELLP syndrome first)
- Drug associated (e.g. quinine)
- Bloody diarrhoea prodrome (as childhood HUS)
- Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation

# Diagnosis
- Clinical diagnosis by **5 clinical features**
    1. Microangiopathic Haemolytic Anaemia (MAHA)
    2. thrombocytopenia
    3. AKI (less marked than HUS)
    4. CNS symptoms (headache, palsies, seizure, coma) (more marked than HUS)
    5. Fever

# Investigations
- RBC↓ and platelets↓
- ↑Reticulocyte count
- ↑LDH and ↑Bil
- Direct Coombs' test -ve (thus r/o autoimmune haemolytic anaemia)
- ↑Urea and ↑creatinine
- Peripheral blood smear- schistocytes

# Management
- **Plasma exchange** (time critical; within 24 hours)
- **Prednisolone**
- Other options: Caplacizumab, Aspirin, folic acid and/or transfusion, immunosuppression, splenectomy
- Long term aspirin after recovery
