# Differential diagnosis of diarrhoea without blood in gastroenteritis
|  Infective agent | Incubation | Characteristic | Presentation | Diagnosis | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Norovirus (also known as Norwalk virus) | 12-48 hrs | Common more in adults than children. Highly infectious from infected people, food, environment | Acute-onset vomiting, watery diarrhoea, cramps, nausea lasting 1-3 days | clinical, stool PCR, enzyme immunoassay | Supportive as self-limiting |
|  Rotavirus | 1-3 days | Common more in children than adults (commonest cause of gastroenteritis in children 50%) | Watery diarrhoea and vomiting for 3–8d, fever, abdominal pain | clinical, stool PCR, enzyme immunoassay | Supportive as self-limiting, Routine vaccination in UK |
|  Enterotoxigenic E. Coli | 1-3 days | Disease due to heat-stable or heat-labile toxin which stimulates Na+, Cl- and water efflux into gut lumen à secretory diarrhoea Major cause of traveller’s diarrhoea. | Watery diarrhoea and vomiting for 3–8d, fever, abdominal pain | Clinical, culture, PCR | Supportive as self-limiting but antibiotics can have a role in shortening treatment duration |
|  Clostridium perfringens (Strain Type A) | 8-12 hrs | Spores survive cooking and germinate during unrefrigerated storage à produce enterotoxins<br/> β‎-toxin of C. perfringens strain type C can cause a necrotizing enteritis with fulminant disease | sudden-onset diarrhoea, cramps, usually lasts <24h | Clinical, PCR, ELISA | Supportive |
|  Cholera (vibrio cholera) | 12 hours to 5 days | Found in faecally contaminated water<br/> Major cause of diarrhoea related mortality and morbidity worldwide <br/> Causes secretory diarrhoea | Profuse (1L/h) diarrhoea (‘**rice-water stool**), vomiting, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, circulatory collapse, death | Stool microscopy and culture | Oral rehydration, Rigler’s lactate, normal saline, electrolytes, zinc in children |
|  Salmonella gastroenteritis (typhoid fever) | 8-14 days | Certain serotypes of S. enterica, primarily serotype Typhi (S. typhi) can cause more severe type of salmonella gastroenteritis called typhoid fever | High fever, body aches, headache, nausea, lethargy, and a possible rash. Asymptomatic carrier possible (think of Typhoid Mary) | Clinical examination and culture | Ciprofloxacin |
|  Bacillus cereus | <6 hrs | By eating questionable rice. Characterised by marked vomiting | Diarrhoea and vomiting | Stool microscopy and culture | Supportive |
|  Vibrio para<br/> haemolyticus | 16-72 hrs | By eating questionable seafood |  | Stool microscopy and culture | Supportive. Antibiotic has a role |
|  Botulism | 18-36 hrs | By eating questionable canned food | Diarrhoea, abdominal<br/> cramps, dry mouth, diplopia, progressive paralysis | Serum/faecal C. Bolulinum toxin | Manage in ITU with mechanical ventilation |
