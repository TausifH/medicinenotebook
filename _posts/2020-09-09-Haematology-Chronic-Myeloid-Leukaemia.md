# Mnemonic
“**Children** and **Middle** aged people are **Abl**e to have a **blast** in **Philadelphia**”
- **CM**L
- Affects **Middle** and **children** aged (usual age 13-40)
- BCR-**ABL** (9:22) aka **Philadelphia** chromosome translocation
- **Blast crisis** and **blast transformation** (i.e. leukaemia)

# Introduction
- Uncontrolled clonal proliferation of myeloid cells
- A type of myeloprofliferative disorder (myelo = myeloid, proliferative= increase in number, *see box*)
- Age 40-60 yrs
- Philadelphia chromosome i.e. a hybrid chromosome due to translocation of ch9 onto ch22 → BCR/ABL gene affected → codes for tyrosine kinase

# Signs and symptoms
- Symptoms (chronic and insidious)
    - **↓weight, tiredness, fever, sweats**
    - abdominal discomfort (splenic enlargement)
- Signs
    - **Splenomegaly** (>75%)—often massive
    - Hepatomegaly, **anaemia**, **bruising**

# Investigation
- Blood count
    ↑↑wbc (often >100×10^9/L) with whole spectrum of myeloid cells, ie ↑ neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils

    - ↓Hb or ↔, platelets variable
- Biopsy
    - Bone marrow hypercellular
- Cytogenetic
    - **Philadelphia chromosome**

# Natural history (3 phase)
- **Chronic phase:** lasting months or years with limited symptoms
- **Accelerated phase:** , spleen size, and difficulty in controlling counts; increasing symptoms
- **Blast transformation:** with features of acute leukaemia ± death

# Management
- Tyrosin kinase inhibitor (TKI) e.g. Imatinib (1st generation), Dasatinib (2nd generation)
- Stem cell transplantation
