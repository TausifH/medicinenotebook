# Introduction
Cytochrome P450 enzymes are a large family of enzymes in the liver involved in breaking down various compounds. 

Many drugs can either induce or inhibit P450 family of enzymes. 

When P450 enzymes are either induced or inhibited, it can effect of the bioavailability of other drugs which are metabolised by it.
