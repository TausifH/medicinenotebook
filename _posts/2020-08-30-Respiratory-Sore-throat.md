# Introduction
- Pain at the back of the mouth
- Encompasses acute pharyngitis and tonsilitis
    - Acute pharyngitis: Inflammation of the oropharynx
    - Tonsilitis: inflammation of the tonsils

# Aetiology
- 70% viral (Adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus)
- 10-30% bacterial; mostly Streptococcus pyogens (aka Group A Beta Haemolytic Streptococcus aka GAS)
    - carriers in 1-5% esp. in children

# Signs and symptoms
- Pharyngeal and soft palate inflammation and/or haemorrhage seen
- Local lymph node enlargement and tender
- Difficult to swallow or eat
- Generalised non-specific symptoms: Fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain

# Bacterial vs Viral infection
- Acute Group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis/tonsillitis is common in children and adolescents aged 5 to 15 years and is more common in the winter (or early spring) in temperate climates
- Important to distinguish between bacterial vs viral cause of sore throat as bacterial infection can cause complication (see below)
- Suspect bacterial infection if: fever >38, tonsillar/pharyngeal exudate, anterior neck lymphadenopathy, and absence of cough
- if GAS needs to be confirmed (in vulnerable group) then arrange a rapid antigen test
- Centor/Fever-PAIN can be used to determine the likelihood of GAS

# Scoring

Two scoring systems exist to determine the likelihood of streptococcal infection 

- Centor scoring
    - Tonsillar exudate
    - Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis
    - History of fever (over 38°C)
    - Absence of cough

0-2= No antibiotics; 3-4= Antibiotics 

- Fever-PAIN
    - **Fever** over 38°C.
    - **P**urulence (pharyngeal/tonsillar exudate).
    - **A**ttend rapidly (3 days or less)
    - Severely **I**nflamed tonsils
    - **N**o cough or coryza

0-1= No antibiotics; 2-3= Consider a back-up antibiotic prescription; 4-5= Antibiotics 

# Complications of bacterial pharyngitis

## Rheumatic fever
- Casued by Strep pyogenes pharyngitis; 5-16 yrs old upto 30 yrs old; symptom start 2 weeks later
- High risk of rheumatic fever: previous history of rheumatic fever, South African, Australian indigenous communities, Maori communities of New Zealand, the Philippines, and other developing countries, extreme of ages,
- Major manifestation: arthritis (flitting polyarthritis, larger joints), carditis, chorea, rash (erythema marginatum), nodules
- Minor: Fever, previous episode, raised ESR/CRP, ECG abnormalities, arthralgia
- Aschoff bodies in heart (10% carditis), prolonged P-R interval, murmurs
- Diagnosis: throat swab, anti-streptolysin O titre, ECHO

## Glomerulonephritis
- Caused by Strep pyogenes pharyngitis or skin infection; 1-5 yrs old; occurs 10-14 days after infection
- Abrupt fever, malaise, loin pain, oedema of feet and face, haematuria and proteinuria, oliguria
- Impaired renal function
- Almost always resolves without specific treatment
- Immune complexes in glomerular basement membrane

## Scarlet fever
- Mostly secondary to pharyngitis due to erythrogenic toxin A,B or C (Streptococal pyrogenic Exotoxins) → 10% of GAS produce these toxins
- Incubation 2-4 days
- Sudden onset of fever; rash follows 12-48 hours later (face, neck, trunk –“sandpaper” texture
- Often pallor around the mouth
- Skin desquamation

# Management 
- If viral cause suspected, then advice self-care
- Hospital admission if
    - Systematically unwell
    - Peri-tonsillar abscess or cellulitis, parapharyngeal abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, or Lemierre syndrome
- Give Antibiotics based on Centor or Fever-PAIN score
    - 1st line: Phenoxymethylpenicillin
    - 2nd line: Clarithromycin or Erythromycin (preferred in Pregnant)
    - Low threshold for antibiotic treatment in people with high risk of Rheumatic fever, vulnerable people including extreme of ages, immunosuppressed or immunocompromised
- AVOID amoxicillin (can cause maculopapular rash if tonsilitis caused by EBV i.e. glandular fever)
