# Key facts
- The commonest cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal failure
- Pathophysiology
    - Hyperglycaemia leads to ↑growth factors, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activation, production of advanced glycosylation end-products, and oxidative stress
    - Causes ↑glomerular capillary pressure, podocyte damage, and endothelial dysfunction
- **Albuminuria** is first clinical sign
- Later scarring (**glomerulosclerosis**), nodule formation (Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions), and fibrosis with progressive loss of renal function made worse by ↑BP

# Diagnosis
- Microalbuminuria; ACR 3–30mg/mmol (not detected on standard dipstick)

# Management
- **Intensive BM control**
    - Aim Hba1c of <53mmol/mol (<7%)- ↓microvascular complications
- **BP <130/80-** for CV and renal protection
    - 1st line: ACE-I or ARB for CV and renal protection
    - Add CCBs and/or Thiazide-like diuretic
- **Sodium restriction** to <2g/day
- **Statins** to ↓CV risk
- Screen for ACR annually
