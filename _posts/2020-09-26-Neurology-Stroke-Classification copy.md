title:  "Stroke- Ischemic stroke classification"
description: "Oxford Community Stroke Project classiﬁcation of sub-types of cerebral infarction aka Bamford classification aka Oxford classification can be used to classify ischaemic stroke based on bedside clinical signs and symptoms. Clinical signs and symptoms of Total Anterior Circulation Infarct (TACI), Partial Anterior Circulation Infarct (PACI), Posterior circulation Infarct (POCI), Lacunar infarct (LACI)  has been described."

# Key facts
- The Oxford Community Stroke Project classiﬁcation of sub-types of cerebral infarction aka Bamford classification aka Oxford classification
- Based on bedside clinical signs and symptoms
- Helpful to appreciate aetiology and prognosis

# Assessment of a suspected stroke patient
When examining a patient with suspected stroke, look for these signs which will help to classify patients into Bamford classification
- Hemiparesis or Hemisensory loss in the Face/Arm/Leg
- Higher cortical dysfunction (including language problems)
- Homonymous hemianopia
- Brainstem signs: Vertigo, dysphagia, diplopia, cerebellar signs

# Nomenclature
Originally developed for ischaemic stroke but can be used in haemorrhagic stroke post-CT scan. 
I= Ischaemic (e.g. PACI) 
S= denoted prior to CT to represent syndrome (PACS) 
H= Haemorrhagic (PACH) 

# Total Anterior Circulation Infarct (TACI)
- Frequency 20%; Mortality at 6 months 56%
- Must have all 3 symptoms below
    - Ipsilateral motor and/or sensory deﬁcit of at least two areas (of face, arm and leg).
    - Higher cerebral dysfunction (e.g. dysphasia)
    - Homonymous visual ﬁeld defect
- Arteries involved
    - MCA and ACA

# Partial Anterior Circulation Infarct (PACI)
- Frequency 35%, Mortality at 6 months 10%
- Must have 2 out of 3 symptoms below OR can present with dysphasia or neglect alone
    - Unilateral motor and/or sensory deﬁcit of at least two areas (of face, arm and leg)
    - Homonymous visual ﬁeld defect
    - Higher cerebral dysfunction (e.g. dysphasia)
- arteries involved: small cortical arteries of the MCA and ACA

# Posterior circulation Infarct (POCI)
- Frequency 25%, Mortality at 6 months 14%
- any of
    - Ipsilateral cranial nerve palsy with contralateral motor and/or sensory deﬁcit
    - Bilateral motor and/or sensory deﬁcit
    - Disorder of conjugate eye movement
    - Cerebellar dysfunction
    - Isolated homonymous visual ﬁeld defect
- Arteries involved: vertebrobasillar artery

# Lacunar infarct (LACI)
- Frequency 25%, Mortality at 6 months 7%
- Any of
    - Pure motor stroke
    - Pure sensory stroke
    - Sensory motor stroke
    - Ataxic haemiparesis
- Arteries involved: lenticulostriate or pontine perforators
