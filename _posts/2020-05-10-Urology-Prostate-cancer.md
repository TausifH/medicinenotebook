# Pathology
- Mostly adenocarcinomas
- Arises on the peripheral zone of the prostate
- Mostly slow-growing but some can be aggressive
- Commonly metastesise to lymph nodes and bones

# Epidemiology
- The most common cancer in men
- Its incidence increases with age: 20% in 50s and 70% in 70s
- Subclinical prostate cancer is common in men aged over 50 years

# Risk factors
- Advanced age
- Afro-Caribbean mean (increased incidence and mortality)
- If one first-degree relative has prostate cancer, the risk is doubled
- Food consumpution (high intake of animal fat and lower intake of fruits, cereals and vegetables)
- Alcohol consumption
- Pattern of sexual behaviour
- Chronic inflammation and occupational exposure

# Screening
- No screening in the UK
    - UK Rational: only small reduction in mortality but ↑ diagnostic and treatment harms

# Presentation
- Local disease:
    - Raised PSA
    - LUTS
    - Urinary tract infection.
- Locally invasive disease:
    - Haematuria, dysuria, incontinence.
    - Haematospermia (blood in ejaculation)
    - Perineal and suprapubic pain.
    - Obstruction of ureters, causing loin pain, anuria, symptoms of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
    - Rectal symptoms - eg, tenesmus (recurrent inclination to empty bowel)
- Metastatic disease (think about metastasis to bones and lymph nodes):
    - Bone pain or sciatica.
    - Paraplegia secondary to spinal cord compression.
    - Lymph node enlargement.
    - Loin pain or anuria due to ureteric obstruction by lymph nodes.
    - Lethargy (anaemia, uraemia).
    - Weight loss, cachexia.

# Signs
- Look for red-flag symptoms in advanced disease:
    - General malaise
    - Bone pain (due to metastasis)
    - Anorexia
    - Weight loss
    - Obstructive nephropathy
    - Paralysis due to cord compression (secondary to metastasis)
- Distended bladder due to overflow obstruction
- DRE examination may reveal a hard, irregular prostate gland. Indication of possible prostate cancer are:
    - Asymmetry of the gland.
    - A nodule within one lobe.
    - Induration of part or all of the prostate.
    - Immobile - adhesion to surrounding tissue
    - Palpable seminal vesicles.

# Differential diagnosis
- Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
- Any other cause of haematuria (e.g. UTI)
- Prostatitis
- Bladder tumour

# Investigations
- PSA ↑
- Urinalysis: haematuria
- Renal function test to exclude renal pathology
- Trans-Rectal Ultrasound guided (TRUS) biopsy
- Transperineal template biopsy: if TRUS negative/  inconclusive but high suspicion
- MRI for staging
- Isotope bone scan for bone mets

# Grading system
- Spread and staging by TNM scoring
- Aggressiveness assessed Gleason score
    - Two areas of tumour specimen analysed for tumour differentiation: Well differentiated (scores 1) → Moderately differentiated → Poorly differentiated (scores 5)
    - The worse score from added up to give 2-10
    - 2-4= Indolent, 5-7= Intermediate, 8-10= Aggressive

# Prognostic factors
Helps to determine between ‘watchful waiting’ vs aggressive treatment: 
- Pre-treatment PSA level
- TNM staging
- Tumour grading- Gleason score

# **Risk stratification (NICE 2014):**
Urology MDT should risk stratify localised disease (T1-T2) as follows:
- Low risk: PSA <10 and Gleason ≤6 and Stage T1 -T2a
- Intermediate risk: PSA 10-20 or Gleason 7 or T2b
- High risk: PSA >20 or Gleason 8-10 or ≥T2c

# Management

<figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">Management of Prostate cancer according to the UK NICE guideline</figcaption>

## Conservative
- Watch and wait
- Indicated in elderly, multiple co-morbidities, low Gleason score with localised disease (harm from treatment > harm from cancer)
## Surgical management
- **Radical prostatectomy (open or laparoscopic)**
    - Generally recommended if life expectancy >10 years (usually offered to patients <70yrs)
    - Robotic surgery
    - SE: Erectile dysfunction (40-30%), Incontinence
## Medical management
- **Active surveillance**
    - Aimed at keeping patient within 'window of curability'
    - Part of curative strategy
    - Delays radical treatment
- **Finasteride**
    - Inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase, an enzyme which metabolises testosterone into dihydrotestosterone. Used for LUTS
    - SE: impotence, low libido, ejaculation disorders, gynaecomastia
- **Radiotherapy**
    - **External beam radiotherapy –** along with surgery, this can be curative. More suitable in elderly but many younger and generally fit patient may chose it as an alternative to surgery. Adverse effects: proctitis, and rectal cancer
    - **Brachytherapy –** radioactive ‘seeds’ are planted in the prostate by TRUS (Systemic SEs reduced) There are two types: Temporary high dose seeds (for advanced cancer) and Permanent low dose seeds (for early cancer)
- **Androgen suppression**
    - Main treatment for metastatic disease
    - Used intermittently in localised or locally advanced disease (to delay refractory disease)
    - Response takes 24-36 months to develop but refractory disease eventually occur.
    - **Synthetic GnRH agonist e.g. Goserelin, Degarelix–** these stop the release of lutenising hormone, and thus the production of testosterone. It first simulate and then inhibit pituitary gonadotrophin → so patient may develop flare-up → give caution → Use anti-androgen in adjunct in susceptible pts
        - SEs: Hot flushes, Sexual dysfunction, Osteoporesis, Gynaecomastia, fatigue
    - **Anti-androgen drugs**: Cyproterone Acetate
    - **Castration –** unacceptable for many
