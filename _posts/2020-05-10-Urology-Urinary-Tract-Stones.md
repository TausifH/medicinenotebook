# Epidemiology
- Common; Prevalence 3%
- ♂ > ♀
- Common in summer months
- 90% urinary stones radio-opaque

# Location
- Pelviureteric junction
- Pelvic brim
- Vesicoureteric junction

# Associated factors
- Dehydration
- Hypercalcaemia: 1° Hyperparathyroidism, immobilisation
- Urinary tract infection
- Hyperuricaemia
- Drugs: Furosemide, Thiazide
- ↑ Oxalate excretion: tea, strawberries

# Types of stones:
- Calcium oxalate (75%)
    - Radio-opaque
- Calcium ammonium phosphate or triple/struvite phosphate (15%)
    - Radio-opaque
    - Large; causes staghorn stone
    - UTI (especially proteus causing)
- Urate (5%)
    - Radio-lucent
    - Caused by hyperuricaemia
    - Smooth and brown
- Hydroxyapatite (5%)
- Cystine (1%)
    - Semi-opaque ‘ground-glass’ appearance
    - Caused by renal tubular defect
    - Associated with Falconi syndrome
- Calcium phosphate
    - Radio-opaque

# Presentation
- Ureteric/Renal colic
    - Loin to groin pain ± N&V ± often cannot lie still (differentiates from peritonitis)
    - Loin pain between 12 rib and lateral edge of lumbar muscles —> suggest renal obstruction
- Obstruction of the lower ureter
    - May lead to symptoms of bladder irritability and pain in scrotum, penile tip, or labia major
- Obstruction in bladder or urethra
    - Pelvic pain ± dysuria (painful or difficulty urinating) ± stangury (desire but inability to void) ± interrupted flow
- Other features
    - On dipstick: Haematuria, proteinuria, sterile pyuria (↑ WCC but culture negative)
    - Anuria
    - UTI
    - Pyelonephritis: fever, rigors, loin pain, nausea, vomiting
    - Pyonephrosis: Infective hydronephrosis

# Investigation
- FBC
- U&Es
- Bone profile (calcium, phosphate, bicarbonate)
- Urate
- Urine dipstick (protein, blood, nitrites etc) à send for MC&S
- Further test for aetiology
    - Urine pH
    - 24 h urine collection (sieve stone and send for testing)
    - Check urine composition of biochemical

# Imaging
- X-ray KUB (Kidney, Ureter, Bladder)- 90% stones radio-opaque
- CT KUB *without* contrast (replaced IV urogram)- Gold standard imaging
- Renal US for hydronephrosis
- Renal ultrasonography
    - Pregnant women
    - Children
    - Follow-up
- MRI
    - Pregnant women
    - Children

# Management

## Initial management
- Pain management and antiemetic
    - **Diclofenac** (NSAIDS) 75mg IV or IM or 100mg PR ± Metoclopramide
- IV fluid
    - If ↓PO intake
- Antibiotics
    - If evidence of infection (**cefuroxime**5g/8h IV, or **gentamicin**)

## Conservative
- Expectant management if <5mm in lower ureter as most will pass spontaneously

## Medical Expulsive Therapy
If >5mm and pain not resolving 
- **Nifedipine** (calcium antagonist, vasodilator) 10mg/8h PO
- **Tamsulosin** (alpha blockers) 0.4mg/day
- Start medical expulsive therapy at presentation
- Most pass within 48 hours (>80% in 30 days)

## Active stone removal
- **Indication**
    - Ureteric obstruction + infection = surgical emergency
    - more than 10mm stone burden
    - Infection
    - Unresolving obstruction
    - Renal insufficiency

- **Surgical emergency**
    - Ureteric obstruction + infection
    - aim is to decompress the system
    - Nephrostomy tube or Ureteric stent aka JJ stent aka Double J stent
- **Exracorporeal shockwave lithrotripsy (ESWL)**
    - external shockwave cause stone fragmentation by cavitation bubbles and mechanical stress
    - uncomfortbale  for patient
    - CI: Pregnancy, AAA
- **Ureteroscopy**
    - Ureteroscope passed retrograde through urethra and bladder into ureter
    - Stone fragmented by laser or pneumatic fragmentation
    - Stent can be placed
- **Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL)**
    - accessed the renal system percutaneously
    - Stone fragmented and removed
