# Epidemiology
- Most common malignancy in males aged 15-44 yo
- 10% occur in undescended testes, even after orchidopexy

# **Risk factors:**
- Cryptorchidism
- infertility
- family history
- Klinefelter's syndrome
- mumps orchitis

# **Classification**
![Classification of testicular tumours including germ cell tumours and sex cord-stromal tumours]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/urology/classification-of-testicular-tumours.png) 
<figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">Classification of Testicular tumour</figcaption>

# **Presentation:**
- Usually **painless** lump
- Painful lump if bleeds inside or infection
- Rarely, changes in testicular volume or consistency
- **Longer history in seminoma** pt than non-seminoma
- Signs of metastasis
    - supraclavicular lymph node
    - Dyspnoea from pulmonary mets

# **Investigations:**
- Bloods: AFP, B-hCG, Lactate dehydrogenase
- Imaging
    - 1st line: **Ultrasound** colour Doppler
    - Other: CT abdomen and chest for staging

# **Seminomous Germ cell tumour**
- **Older patients** (avg. 40 years)
- 25% metastasise at presentation
- Excellent prognosis even with advanced disease (5 year survival of 73%)
- Tumour marker not typically raise: AFP normal, **↑ HCG (10%)**, ↑LDH (10%)
- Strong association with **cryptorchidism**
- May present with mass in the undescended testes in the inguinal region or the abdomen

# **Non-seminomatous germ cell tumours**
- **Younger** patients (20-30 year olds)
- Advanced disease = poor prognosis (48% at 5 years)
- Biomarkers
    - Embryonal carcinoma: ↑AFP /↑B-hCG
    - **Yolk sac tumour: ↑AFP characteristic**
    - **Choriocarcinoma:↑B-hCG characteristic**
    - Teratoma: ↑AFP /↑B-hCG

# Sex cord-stromal tumour
- Arise from supportive connective tissue around germ cells
- Rare, less than 5% of testicular cancer
- Excellent prognosis after surgical resection
- Two types of tumour: Leydig cell tumour, Sertoli cell tumour

# Lymphoma
- Most common cause of a **testicular mass in males > 60 years old**; often **bilateral**
- Usually of **diffuse large B-cell type**

# Staging
- Stage 1: No evidence of metastasis
- Stage 2: Infradiaphragmatic node involvement (spread via para-aortic nodes)
- Stage 3: Supradiaphragmatic node involvement
- Stage 4: Lung involvement (haematogenous)

# Management
- **SGCT**
    - Orchidectomy (via inguinal approach to prevent lymphatic spread)
    - Extremely radiosensitive
    - NOTE: orchidectomy and radiotherapy cures 95% in stage 1
- **NSGCT**
    - Orchidectomy (inguinal approach)
    - 3 cycles of Bleomycin + Etoposide + Cisplatin
- **Follow-up**
    - Do close follow up using biomarkers, reviews and self-examination
