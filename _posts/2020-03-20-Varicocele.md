A varicocele is the abnormal dilation  pampiniform plexus and the internal spermatic vein that drain blood from the testis. 
Left side (90%)> Right side (10%) 
Bilateral varicoceles may affect fertility

# Aetiology
- Mostly idiopathic
- Left sided renal tumour (which may invade the left renal vein and prevent drainage of blood)

# History
- Painless scrotal mass
- Scrotum feels heavy
- Look for family history of varicocele (especially brothers)
- May be presenting with features of renal cell carcinoma

# Examination
- <span style="color:red"> **Worm-like** </span>venous dilatation
- Does not transilluminate (important to distinguish it from Hydrocele)
- Small testicle on the affected side (due to testicular growth arrest)

# Investigations
- Usually by clinical features
- USS if uncertain or difficult examination
- Semen analysis and serum testosterone- men with subfertility and varicocele

# Management
- Adolescent:
    - Sub-clinical: reassurance
    - <20% size difference or symmetrical testes: observation
    - Asymetrical testes: Surgery
- Adults
    - Usually conservative by observation
    - Surgery if symptomatic, or atrophic testes or, subfertility
        - Varicocelectomy, surgical ligation/embolisation of the affected vein
