# Mnemonic
- **LSAT** (used for Rai scoring system  as well as signs/symptoms)
    Rai scoring system
    - Stage 0: High WBC  Stage 1: **L**ymphadenopathy Stage 2: **S**plenomegaly + Hepatomegaly  Stage 3: **A**nemia Stage 4: **T**hrombocytopenia

# Introduction
- Progressive accumulation of malignant clone of functionally incompetent B-lymphocytes (abnormal proliferation of abnormal cells)
- affects **older patients** (in 60s )

# Signs and symptoms
- Constitutional symptoms but can have no signs
- Signs as per mnemonic above

# Tests
- High lymphocytes
- Later: autoimmune haemolysis
- Marrow infiltration causes: anaemia, decreased neutrophils and platelets (as per mnemonic)

# Complications
- Autoimmune haemolysis.
- ↑Infection due to low WCC (=↓IgG), bacterial, viral especially herpes zoster
- Marrow failure

# Natural history
- ⅓ never progress (or even *regress*), ⅓ progress slowly, and ⅓ progress actively
- Death is often due to infection or transformation to aggressive **lymphoma** (**Richter’s syndrome**)

# Management
- Chemotherapy if symptomatic
- Radiotherapy for lymphoadenopathy and splenomegaly
- Steroid for autoimmune haemolysis
- Stem cell transplantation in selected patients
- Supportive: transfusion
