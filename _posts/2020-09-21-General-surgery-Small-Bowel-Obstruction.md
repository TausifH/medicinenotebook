title:  "Small Bowel Obstruction"
description: "Small bowel obstruction is a surgical emergency. The most common cause of small bowel obstruction is adhesion followed by hernia. There are 4 cardinal features of small bowel obstruction, namely colicky abdominal pain, distnesion, vomiting and absolute obstruction. Management of small bowel obstruction can either be conservative (drip and suck) or surgical"

# Key facts
- A surgical emergency
- 5% of all surgical admission

# Pathophysiology
- Obstruction → Dialation of the small bowel above the level of obstruction →  causes mucosal oedema → initially causes venous followed by arterial blood flow obstruction → ischaemia ensues
- ischeamia → infarction and perforation
- Ischaemia → bacterial translocation

# Aetiology
Based on the most common presentation 
- Adhesions (60%)
- Strangulated hernia (20%)
- Malignancy (5%)
- Volvulus (5%)

# Aetiology based on anatomy
- Luminal (inside the wall)
    - Foreign body
    - Gallstones (gallstone ileus )
    - Bezoars (clump of swallowed hair)
- Intraluminal (in the wall)
    - Crohn's stricture
    - Small bowel tumour
    - Congenital atresia
    - Malignancy (rare in small bowel)
- Extraluminal (outside the wall)
    - Adhesion (most common)
    - Hernia (second most common)
    - Intussusception
    - Congenital adhesion band
    - External compression (neoplastic mass)

# Signs and symptoms
4 cardinal features 
- Colicky abdominal pain
- Distention
- Vomiting
- Absolute constipation (no faeces and flatus)

Prominence and timing of these features depends on the site of obstruction 
- Gastric outlet obstruction- vomiting early and +++; virtually no distension +; late absolute constipation; pain higher in the abdomen
- Small bowel- Vomiting early ++; distension ++, pain higher in the abdomen
- Distal colon- Vomiting very late +; Distension +++; early absolute constipation +++; pain lower in the abdomen and often constant

# Examination

# Investigations
- All of these investigations are first line
- Bloods: FBC, U&Es, LFT, amylase/lipase, Capillary BM, CRP, Clotting, G&S, ABG/VBG
- Abdominal x-ray: >3cm dilation of small bowel which can be identified by valvulae conniventes (bands which completely traverse the bowel), and bowel position centrally on the film
- Erect CXR: to r/o perforation
- Gastrograffin follow through (consider after failed conservative management)
- CT: to identify site and cause of obstruction

# Management
- Mnemonic: Drip (IV fluid) and Suck (NG tube)
- Initial management for every patients
    1. Fluid resuscitation ('drip)
        - Can be severely dehydrated due to vomiting, third space loss and sequestration of fluid into the dilated bowel (up to 6- 8 litres)
        - Accurate fluid balance monitoring which may mean urinary catheter insertion
    2. Bowel decompression i.e. NG tube ('suck')
    3. Analgesia e.g. Morphine SC/IM 
    4. Determine the cause of obstruction 
- To surgery or not to surgery? (laparotomy + resection)
    1. Adhesional obstruction 
        - usually resolves with conservative management
        - If not settled  by 48 hours or evidence of ischaemia or peritonitis, then surgery
    2. All other cause 
        - Absolute indication for surgery: generalised or localised peritonitis, visceral perforation, 
        irreducible hernia
        - Relative indication for surgery: palpable mass lesion, virgin abdomen, failed conservative management,50% in 3 months and 95% in 1 year
