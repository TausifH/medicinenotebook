* **Lifestyle:**
  * ↓Alcohol and tobacco
* **H.pylori eradication (as above):**
  * Triple therapy is 80–85% effective at eradication
  * Drugs to reduce acid:
  * PPIs are effective, eg lansoprazole 30mg/24h PO for 4 weeks (DU) or 8 weeks (GU)
  * H2 blockers have a place (ranitidine 300mg each night PO for 8wks)
* **Drug-induced ulcers:**
  * Stop drug if possible
  * PPIs may be best for treating and preventing GI ulcers and bleeding in patients on NSAIDs or antiplatelet drugs
  * Misoprostol is an alternative with different SE
  * If symptoms persist, re-endoscope, retest for H.pylori, and reconsider differential diagnoses (eg gallstones).
