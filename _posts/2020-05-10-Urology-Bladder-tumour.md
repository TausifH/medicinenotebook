# Epidemiology
2nd most common. It most commonly affects males aged between 50 and 80 years of age. Those who are current, or previous (within 20 years), smokers have a 2-5 fold increased risk of the disease.   

# **Pathology**
- **Histology (cell type)**
    - Transitional cell carcinoma TCC (>90% of cases) NB most have papillary pattern
    - Squamous cell carcinoma SCC ( 1-7%)
    - Adenocarcinoma (2%)
- **Morphology (appearance)**
    - Papillary (70%) (better prognosis as less muscle invasion)
    - Sessile or mixed (20% worse prognosis)
    - Nodular
> Papillary TCC is the most common histopathological diagnosis

# **Risk factors:**
- Risk factors for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder:
    - Smoking
    - Exposure to aniline dyes in the printing and textile industry: examples are 2-naphthylamine and benzidine
    - Rubber manufacture
    - Cyclophosphamide
- Risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder:
    - Schistosomiasis
    - Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) treatment
    - Smoking

# **Presentation**
- Gross painless haematuria (in 85% of patients)
- Haematuria can be microscopic (typically seen in females)
- Symptoms of bladder irritation- dysuria, frequency and urgency

# **TNM Staging**

# **Staging**
- Most will undergo a cystoscopy and biopsies or TURBT, this provides histological diagnosis and information relating to depth of invasion.
- Local spread by MRI
- Distant disease by CT scanning.
- Nodes of uncertain significance by PET CT

# **3 main prognostic groups**
- Low-grade proliferative lesions that develop into non-muscle invasive tumours (~80%)
- Highly proliferative invasive tumours with a propensity to metastasise (high risk also of recurrence and progression)
- Carcinoma in situ- which can penetrate the lamina propria and eventually progress

# **Management**
- **Tis/Ta/T1 (non-muscle invasive)**
    - TURBT
    - Intravesical BCG
    - Chemo with mitomycin, epirubicin, and gencitabine
- **T2-3 (muscle invasive)**
    - Radical cystectomy is gold standard (better than radiotherapy)
    - Orthotopic reconstruction of the bladder using ileum is an option if baldder neck not involved
    - Neo-adjuvant and adjuvant chemo with M-VAC (MTX, VinB, Dox, Cis)
- **T4 (organ invasive)**
    - Palliative chemo/radiotherapy
    - Long term catheter

    # Follow up cystoscopy
    - Low risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer: @ 3 months and 12 months after diagnosis
    - Intermediate risk non-muscle invasive: @ 3, 9, 18 months and once a year thereafter
    - High risk non-muslce invasive: @ 3 months for 2 years, 6 monthly for 2 years and once a year thereafter
