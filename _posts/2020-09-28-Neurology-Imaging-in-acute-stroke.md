# Key facts
- CT is the investigation of choice in acute stroke due to its availability and speed
- However, MRI is most sensitive
- CT scan in suspected stroke patient is used to rule out haemorrhagic stroke/other CNS pathology e.g. tumour
- Once haemorrhagic stroke r/o, and if clinical indicators suggest ischaemic stroke, thrombolysis treatment can be initiated

# CT scan in stroke
- Immediate (within minutes): Clot may be seen (esp. in MCA territory) but otherwise no other signs
- Hyperacute phase (0-24 hours): Clot may be seen, Loss of grey-white matter differentiation, cortical hypodensity (especially to areas with poor collateral supplies such as the insular ribbon)
- Acute (24hrs-1week): Marked hypodensity and swelling; swelling can lead to mass effect
- Subacute (1-3 weeks): Some small (petechial) haemorrhages (not haemorrhagic transformation; this phenomenon is known as CT fogging), brain matter can look near normal as swelling reduces

# MRI in acute stroke
- Highly sensitive
- Within minutes of occlusion, diffusion weighed imaging (DWI) can identify ischaemic core
- High DWI and low ADC (Apparent diffusion co-efficient) can persist for up to a week
- T2 signal is raised especially on FLAIR in acute phase
- After a week ADC value starts to rise
- If brain parenchymal enhancement persists >12 weeks Ã  consider underlying lesion

# CT perfusion
- An emerging tool
    - accurate diagnosis of ischaemic stroke
    - allows identification of penumbra (salvageable brain with reperfusion)

# CT angiography
- To identify clot (thrombus) for thrombolysis or clot retrieval
- To assess carotid and vertebral arteries for stroke aetiology and/or assess for endovascular access
