# Definition
- Submucosal venous dilatation secondary to ↑portal pressures
- Not necessarily need to have a liver pathology—suspect if alcohol history
- Bleeding can be brisk, particularly if underlying coagulopathy 2° to loss of hepatic synthesis of clotting factors

# Pathogenesis (from liver cirrhosis)

Progressive fibrosis and architectural reorganization of the liver (including nodule formation) → nodules produce contractile elements in the liver's vascular bed → portal hypertension (from 9mmHg to 12mmHg) → arterial splanchnic vasodilation in response to portal hypertension (blood vessels supplying visceral organs) → hyperdynamic circulation (i.e. increased cardiac output, HR and decreased vascular resistance) → salt and water retention → increase portal flow → formation of collateral (porto-systemic collateral) between the portal and systemic systems e.g. in the lower oesophageal and gastric cardia → gastro-oesophageal varices develop once portal pressure is >10mmgHg (>12mmHg causes bleeding)

Variecs can also be found in the umbilicus (caput medusa, rare) and rectum

# Causes

- Pre-hepatic
    - Thrombosis (portal or splenic vein)
- Intrahepatic
    - Cirrhosis (80%)
    - Schistosomiasis (commonest worldwide)
    - Sarcoid
    - Myeloproliferative disease
    - Congenital hepatic fibrosis
- Post hepatic
    - Budd-Chiari syndrome
    - Right heart failure
    - Constrictive pericarditis
    - Veno-occlusive disease

# Management

## Blood transfusion
Blood transfusion should be started when the haemoglobin level reaches 7 g/dL, and maintained between 7 g/dL and 9 g/dL (restrictive transfusion policy).[5][33][34] Blood transfusion above this threshold may increase mortality.[32]

## All pateints with chirosis and variceal bleed
- Step 1: **Terlipressin** or **Somatostatin**  (synthetic analogue of vasopressin → splanchnic arterial constriction, CI: IHD)
- Step 2: 7 day prophylactic antibiotics (all patients with chirosis and variceal bleed) to cover gram negative infection
- Step 3: **Endoscopy** (**bang ligation or sclerotherapy**) within 12 hours Band-ligation is superior to sclerotherapy

## In selective patients with chirosis and variceal bleed
- Step 4: Early **Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunting (TIPS)** (esp. as rescue therapy if Step 1-3 fails, in high risk pateints Child-Pugh class C (with a score <14) or class B with active bleeding within 24-72 hours from admission ) A metal stent is passed over a guidewire in the internal jugular vein and then pushed into the liver substance under radiological guidance. A shunt is formed between the portal and hepatic vein, thus lowering the portal pressure.
- Step 3: if above fails, **balloon tamponed** with a **Sengstaken-Blakemore tube** (Risks: aspiration pneumonia, tissue necrosis, oesophageal rupture)

- Step 5: Surgery (oesophageal transection and ligation of varices) if all above fails.

**Prevention:**

Recurrence high so need prophylaxis (primary or secondary) to prevent re-bleed

- **Propranolol** as both primary and secondary prophylaxis
- Repeated courses of **variceal banding**
- **TIPS** or occasionally a surgical portosystemic shunt
