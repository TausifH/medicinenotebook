# Key facts

- Non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland
- Commonly seen in older men
- Commonest cause of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in older men

# Risk factors

- Age: around 50% of 50-year-old men will have evidence of BPH and 30% will have symptoms. Around 80% of 80-year-old men have evidence of BPH
- Ethnicity: black > white > Asian

# Symptoms

BPH typically presents with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), which may be categorised into:

FUN WISE Dribble

- *Storage symptoms (irritative*): Frequency, urgency, nocturia
- *voiding symptoms (obstructive):* Weak stream, intermittent urinary flow, straining, emptying incompletion
- *Post-micturition:* dribbling
- Complications: urinary tract infection, retention, obstructive uropathy

# Signs

- On DRE: smooth enlarged prostate

# Investigation

- International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) to assess severity
- DRE and PSA to rule out malignancy
- Renal function
- Urine analysis in all patient
- Urodynamics: Urine flowmetry and pressure
- If concern over malignancy
    - Transrectal ultrasound Â± guided biopsy

# Management

## Conservative

- Watchful waiting

## Medical management

Recommended for those with LUTS and affecting QoL 

- **Alpha-1 antagonists e.g. tamsulosin, alfuzosin, doxazosin**
    - decrease smooth muscle tone (prostate and bladder)
    - considered first-line, improve symptoms in around 70% of men
    - SE: dizziness, postural hypotension, dry mouth, depression
- **5 alpha-reductase inhibitors e.g. finasteride**
    - Block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is known to induce BPH
    - Unlike alpha-1 antagonists causes a reduction in prostate volume and hence may slow disease progression. This however takes time and symptoms may not improve for 6 months. They may also decrease PSA concentrations by up to 50%
    - SE:erectile dysfunction, reduced libido, ejaculation problems, gynaecomastia

## Surgical management

- Indication: Failed medical therapy, worsening QoL
- Transurethral Resection of Prostate (TURP)- gold standard
- Open retropubic prostectomy- for large gland
- Transurethral incision in the prostate (TUIP)- causes less destruction and reduced sexual dysfunction
- Laser Prostectomy
- Microwave thermotherpay ablation of the prostate
