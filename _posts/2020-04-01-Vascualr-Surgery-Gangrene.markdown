# Pathology
- Gangrene is a form of necrotic tissue death
- Two types of cellular/tissue death: Necrosis and Apoptosis
1. Necrosis (poorly controlled tissue death —> cell content leakage —> inflammation) 
    - Coagulative necrosis
        - nuclear loss but cell remains it's general shape
    - Liquefactive necrosis
        - complete loss of struction leading to soft semi-solid mash (seen in cerebral infarction)
    - Casceous necrosis
        - Coagulative necrosis + Liquefactive necrosis = Cottage cheese apparance macroscopically; classically seen in TB as granulomatous inflammation
    - Gangrene
        - Coagulative necrosis modified by exposure to air resulting in drying (dry gangrene)
        - Dry gangrene + infection leads to wet gangrene
        - Gas gangrene: A subtype of wet gangrene caused by Clostrodial species, most commonly *C. perfingens*
2. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) 
    - Controlled cell death

# Aetiology of  gangrene
- Dry gangrene (aka ischaemic gangrene, mainly arterial)
    - Atherosclerosis
        - PAD
        - Diabetes
        - Smoking
    - Thrombosis
        - Vasculitis
        - IVDU
        - Trauma
        - Malignancy
- Wet gangrene
    - Dry gangrene + polymicrobial superadded infection
- Gas gangrene
    - Most commonly Clostridium perfringens

# Management
Management depends on the subtype.  

## Dry gangrene
- Heparin bolus and then infusion
- Threatened (limb salvagable with intervention)
    - Surgical revascularisation (bypass) +/- Amputaition if life expectancy >2 yrs
    - Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTS) +/- Amputation if life expectancy <2 yrs
- Non-viable limb (major tissue loss; limb not salvagable)
    - Amputation

## Wet gangrene
- Broad-spectrum iv antibiotics
- surgical debridement ± amputation

## Gas gangrene
- Surgical debridement ± amputation
- IV Benzylpenicillin + Clindamycin
- Hyperbaric O2 therapy can improve survival
