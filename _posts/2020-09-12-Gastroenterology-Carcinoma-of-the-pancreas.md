# Key facts
- ≈3% of all malignancy; ~9000 deaths/yr (UK)
- Typically male patient in their 70s
- Major risk factors: smoking, chronic pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, ↑waist circumference (ie adiposity), Red or processed meat diet
- Metastasize early; present late
- Extremely poor prognosis

# Pathology
- Mostly (90%) ductal adenocarcinoma
- 60% arise in the pancreas head, 25% in the body, 15% tail
- Other site of origin (better prognosis): Ampulla of Vater (ampullary tumour), pancreatic islet cells (insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonomas, somatostatinomas, VIPomas)
- ~95% have mutations in the **KRAS2 gene**

# Symptoms
- Tumours in the head of the pancreas present with **painless obstructive jaundice**
- Tumours in the body and tail present with **epigastric pain** (radiates to back and relieved by sitting forward)
- Anorexia, weight loss, diabetes, or acute pancreatitis.
- Rarer features:
    - Thrombophlebitis migrans (eg an arm vein becomes swollen and red, then a leg vein); ↑Calcium
    - Marantic endocarditis
    - Portal hypertension (splenic vein thrombosis)
    - Nephrosis (renal vein metastases)

# Signs
- **Jaundice + palpable gallbladder (Courvoisier’s ‘law’)** → cancer until proven otherwise
- Epigastric mass
- Hepatomegaly/ splenomegaly
- Lymphadenopathy
- Ascites

# Investigations
- Blood: **Cholestatic jaundice,↑Ca19–9**
- Imaging:
    - **US or CT** (pancreatic mass ± dilated biliary tree ± hepatic metastases, help guide biopsy, stent insertion)
    - **ERCP/MRCP** for bile duct assessment
    - **EUS (endoscopic ultrasonography)**

# Management
Most ductal cancers present with metastatic disease; <20% are suitable for radical surgery.

- **Surgery: pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple’s procedure)** when no distant metastases and where vascular invasion is still at a minimum.
- **Laparoscopic excision** if tail lesion
- **Adjuvant chemotherapy-** delays disease progression
- Endoscopic or percutaneous **stent insertion** for jaundice palliation
- **Pain- ↑ dose opiates,** coeliac plexus infiltration with alcohol

# Prognosis
- Very poor; Mean survival <6 months; 5yr survival: 3%
